**AUS Logistics** is an independent business contracted with FedEx Ground to provide pickup and delivery services. Based in the **DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth)** area, we have grown from a small operation to a robust fleet serving thousands of customers daily across the Metroplex.

### Our Mission
To provide reliable, efficient, and safe delivery services while cultivating a workplace where drivers feel respected, valued, and supported.

### The AUS Difference
Unlike mega-corporations, we are locally owned and operated right here in DFW. The owner knows every driver by name. We believe that if we take care of our team, our team will take care of the customers.

We maintain high standards for:
* **Fleet Maintenance:** We don't cut corners on repairs.
* **Uniforms:** We ensure our team looks professional.
* **Training:** We provide paid training to ensure you are confident behind the wheel.
